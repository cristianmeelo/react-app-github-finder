## üìö More tutorial information

PokeNext is an application for github profiles consultation, developed from the tutorial [Matheus Battisti](https://www.youtube.com/@MatheusBattisti). The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis implementation tutorial is to learn and develop the concepts of typescript, a programming language that is being demanded by the market, and honestly, I feel more comfortable using it than not using it, but it takes a while to understand the depth of its usability. React's routing system is usually used with router router, there are some particularities between its versions, and learning new ways of architecting a project greatly strengthens our baggage.
